## Description
The Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 season was the 16th edition of the popular T20 cricket tournament. The season featured ten teams competing in a series of matches held across various venues in India. The season included intense group-stage matches, leading to thrilling playoffs and a highly anticipated final. IPL 2023 continued to showcase high-level cricketing talent, drawing large crowds and global viewership. This project involves an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and trends that defined the IPL 2023 season.

## Objective

3. **Inning Analysis**
    - Assess the scoring patterns in different innings and overs.
    - Analyze the contribution of runs from different players in various phases of the game.
    - Evaluate the performance of bowlers in different overs.

4. **Team Performance**
    - Compare the performance of teams throughout the season.
    - Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each team based on their performance in matches.
